### BP / Bullet Proof

It receives no damage from direct hits from bullets.

### DP / Damage Proof

### AP / CP / All Proof / Comprehensive Proof

If a car is BP/DP/EP/FP/MP, it is AP.

## Configuration

### `carcols.dat`

In GTA SA, vehicles are colored accoring to the config `data/carcols.dat` in game install directory. The `carcols.dat` was seperated into three segments. In first segment, all car colors was defined with 
RGB, commented with color ID and name. 1 - 10 is service colors on special vehicles, such *police car blue* and *taxi yellow*. The following segments defines mapping of cars and car colors. In each line, it starts with the car name, and the following are pairs of color ID seperated with commas. The former in pairs indicates primary car color, while the latter indicates secondary car colors. In most cases, the color how cars looks like depends on the primary color.
